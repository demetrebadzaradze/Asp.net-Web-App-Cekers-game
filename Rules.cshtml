<h2>How to Play Checkers</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Checkers is a two-player game that is played on an 8x8 checkerboard.</li>
    <li>Each player starts with 12 pieces, which are placed on the dark squares of the first three rows of their side of the board.</li>
    <li>The pieces can only move diagonally, and can only move forward (unless they are "kinged" - see below).</li>
    <li>A piece can capture an opponent's piece by jumping over it diagonally to an empty square behind it. Multiple captures can be made in a single turn if the opportunity arises.</li>
    <li>If a piece reaches the far end of the board (the opponent's side), it becomes a "king" and gains the ability to move and capture diagonally in any direction.</li>
    <li>The game ends when one player captures all of the other player's pieces, or when one player cannot make a move.</li>
</ol>
